        <figcaption id="img-caption"><strong>Quincy Larson</strong> was a school director for six years before he started to learn to code so that he could create tools for making schools more efficient.[7] His own journey into learning to code was long and winding[8] and he recognized the need for a single-track curriculum for newbie developers. Upon analyzing data on coding boot camps in the US and realizing how inaccessible coding education was to the masses,[9] he set out to create a fully-online inclusive free platform for peer-driven learning of coding - the result of which is freeCodeCamp.</figcaption>

      <div id="tribute-info">
      <p>He lives in Texas with his family and spends his time working on freeCodeCamp, writing and interviewing authors for the freeCodeCamp publication, co-ordinating open source projects such as Chapter (a free MeetUp alternative),[10] advocating for a free and open internet[11] and playing with his two young kids.The self-paced curriculum[12] involves 1,400 hours of interactive coding challenges and web development projects, plus 800 hours of contributing to open-source[13] projects for nonprofits and is constantly expanded by more challenges and projects.</p>
      <p>[4] This translates into about one year of full-time coding. The curriculum is divided into Responsive Web Design, JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures, Front End Libraries, Data Visualization, APIs and Microservices, and Information Security and Quality Assurance. Participants receive a certificate after completing each section.[14]</p> 
      <p>The curriculum emphasizes pair programming, intended to foster a culture of collaboration and shared learning, which can overcome a student's doubts about the adequacy of their skills (popularly referred to as “impostor syndrome”).[15]</p>
      <p>The languages and technologies currently taught by freeCodeCamp include HTML5, PHP, CSS 3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, Sass, React.js, Node.js, Python, Express.js, MongoDB, and Git.[16]</p>
      <p>To celebrate freeCodeCamp's 8th birthday on October 25, 2022, Quincy Larson published a tweet that announced free accredited degree programs in mathematics and computer science are currently in active development. Official release dates are still to be determined.[17]</p>
      <p>Until now, FreeCodeCamp runs the largest programming channel on YouTube, with 7.58 million subscribers.[18] They have made more than 700 full-length programming courses freely available there, and new courses are published every week.[19]</p>
